/*
Method 2: Use the DBCC SHRINKDATABASE command
	Use the DBCC SHRINKDATABASE command to shrink the tempdb database. 
	DBCC SHRINKDATABASE receives the parameter target_percent. 
	This is the desired percentage of free space left in the database file after the database is shrunk. 
	If you use DBCC SHRINKDATABASE, you may have to restart SQL Server.

    Determine the space that is currently used in tempdb by using the sp_spaceused stored procedure. 
	Then, calculate the percentage of free space that is left for use as a parameter to DBCC SHRINKDATABASE. 
	This calculation is based on the desired database size.
    Note In some cases, you may have to execute sp_spaceused @updateusage=true 
	to recalculate the space that is used and to obtain an updated report. 
	Refer to SQL Server Books Online for more information about the sp_spaceused stored procedure.

	sp_spaceused

    Consider the following example:
    Assume that tempdb has two files: 
		the primary data file (Tempdb.mdf) that is 100 MB 
		and the log file (Tempdb.ldf) that is 30 MB. 
	
	Assume that sp_spaceused reports that the primary data file contains 60 MB of data. 
	Also, assume that you want to shrink the primary data file to 80 MB. 
	Calculate the desired percentage of free space left after the shrink: 80 MB - 60 MB = 20 MB. 
	Now, divide 20 MB by 80 MB = 25 percent, and that is yourtarget_percent. 
	
	The transaction log file is shrunk accordingly, leaving 25 percent or 20 MB of space free after the database is shrunk.
    
	Connect to SQL Server by using Query Analyzer, and then run the following Transact-SQL commands:

       dbcc shrinkdatabase (tempdb, 'target percent') 
       -- This command shrinks the tempdb database

	There are limitations for use of the DBCC SHRINKDATABASE command on the tempdb database. 
	The target size for data and log files cannot be smaller than the size that is specified 
	when the database was created or smaller than the last size that was explicitly set by using a
	file-size-changing operation such as ALTER DATABASE that uses the MODIFY FILE option or the command.
	Another limitation of BCC SHRINKDATABASE is the calculation of the target_percentage parameter 
	and its dependency on the current space that is used.

Method 3: Use the DBCC SHRINKFILE command
	Use the DBCC SHRINKFILE command to shrink the individual tempdb files. 
	DBCC SHRINKFILE provides more flexibility than DBCC SHRINKDATABASE because you can use it 
	on a single database file without affecting other files that belong to the same database. 
	DBCC SHRINKFILE receives the target size parameter. This is the desired final size for the database file.

    Determine the desired size for the primary data file (tempdb.mdf), the log file (templog.ldf),
	and additional files that are added to tempdb. Make sure that the space that is used in the files 
	is less than or equal to the desired target size.
    Connect to SQL Server by using Query Analyzer, and then run the following Transact-SQL commands 
	for the specific database files that you want to shrink:

       use tempdb
       go

       dbcc shrinkfile (tempdev, 'target size in MB')
       go
       -- this command shrinks the primary data file

       dbcc shrinkfile (templog, 'target size in MB')
       go
       -- this command shrinks the log file, examine the last paragraph.

	An advantage of DBCC SHRINKFILE is that it can reduce the size of a file to a size that	is smaller than its original size. 
	You can issue DBCC SHRINKFILE on any of the data or log files. 
	A limitation of DBCC SHRINKFILE is that you cannot make the database smaller than the size of the model database.
