Heaps (Tables without Clustered Indexes)
summary:
    This query finds the following table smells
    1/ is a Wide table (set this to what you consider to be wide)
    2/ is a Heap - Heaps (Tables without Clustered Indexes)
    3/ is an undocumented table
    4/ Has no Primary Key
    5/ Has no index at all
    6/ No candidate key (unique constraint on column(s))
    7/ Has disabled Index(es)
    8/ Has disabled constraint(s)'
    9/ Has untrusted constraint(s)'
    10/ Has a disabled Foreign Key'
    11/ Has untrusted FK'
    12/ Has unrelated to any other table'
    13/ Has unintelligible column names'
    14/ Has a foreign key that has no index'
    15/ Has a GUID in a clusterd Index
    16/ Has non-compliant column names'
    17/ Has a trigger that has'nt got NOCOUNT ON'
    18/ Is not referenced by any procedure, view or function'
    19/ Has  a disabled trigger' 
    20/ Can't be indexed'
