Windows could not start the SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS) on Local Computer. For more information, review the System Event Log. 
If this is a non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to service-specific error code 10013.

SQL Server could not spawn FRunCommunicationsManager thread. Check the SQL Server error log and the operating system error log for information about possible related problems.

Could not start the network library because of an internal error in the network library. To determine the cause, review the errors immediately preceding this one in the error log.

TDSSNIClient initialization failed with error 0x271d, status code 0x1. Reason: Initialization failed with an infrastructure error. Check for previous errors. An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions. 

TDSSNIClient initialization failed with error 0x271d, status code 0xa. Reason: Unable to initialize the TCP/IP listener. An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions. 

Server TCP provider failed to listen on [ 'any' <ipv6> 1433]. Tcp port is already in use.

OK   
---------------------------

Go to Start > Microsoft SQL Server < SQL_server_version> > SQL Server Configuration Manager. 
Go to SQL Server Network Configuration > Protocols for <SQL_server_version>.
Go to TCP/IP > IP addresses, scroll down to the IPAll settings group and change necessary TCP port to any other free port in the range 49152â€“65535:


netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt

cls & netstat -oanb -p tcp 

netsh int ipv4 show dynamicportrange tcp
netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange tcp startport=1433 numberofports=1 store=persistent

netsh int ipv6 show dynamicportrange tcp
netsh int ipv6 add excludedportrange tcp startport=1433 numberofports=1 store=persistent


Only assign one IP to use port 1433 and configure others for dynamic value, 
by setting TCP Dynamic Ports to 0 and blank off the TCP Port value. 

I chose 127.0.0.1 (loopback IP @ local) to bind with. 
Restart your SQL Server service.
