Monitoring query performance
Slow or long running queries can consume significant system resources. This section demonstrates how to use dynamic management views to detect a few common query performance problems.

Finding top N queries
The following example returns information about the top five queries ranked by average CPU time. This example aggregates the queries according to their query hash, so that logically equivalent queries are grouped by their cumulative resource consumption.
