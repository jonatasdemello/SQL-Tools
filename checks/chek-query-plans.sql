-- Monitoring query plans

-- An inefficient query plan also may increase CPU consumption. The following example uses the sys.dm_exec_query_stats view to determine which query uses the most cumulative CPU.

SELECT
    highest_cpu_queries.plan_handle,
    highest_cpu_queries.total_worker_time,
    q.dbid,
    q.objectid,
    q.number,
    q.encrypted,
    q.[text]
FROM
    (SELECT TOP 50
        qs.plan_handle,
        qs.total_worker_time
    FROM
        sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
ORDER BY qs.total_worker_time desc) AS highest_cpu_queries
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(plan_handle) AS q
ORDER BY highest_cpu_queries.total_worker_time DESC;
